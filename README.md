   ## 1. Install
This extension is now published on [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nasextwallet/gehjkhmhclgnkkhpfamakecfgakkfkco). Wellcome to install and take a try!

We will keep improving this extension, and any suggestions are welcome! 

**Note:** If you need to test local html files, you need to turn on the "Allow access to file URLs" option at extension management page:

Why another extension wallet?
We are a software development team, and we (and our partners) have specific requests for businesses. Instead of telling other extensions that they need to add the features we want, we decided that we will create our own extension and at the same time provide more options to end users... Competition is the key to increasing the Stellar ecosystem.

But even if our wallet is aimed to serve our businesses, we designed it in a way it can be used by anyone so it's most likely that you will never notice that it was built with our projects in mind.


### 2. Brief introduction of using our ExtensionWallet
```
(1) In tab `New-Wallet`, you can create your own wallet, and download the keystore files.
(2) In tab `Send-TX`, you can import your keystore file, and then your account will be stored within the extension.
(3) After your account keyfile is imported, you can send NAS to other account address.
(4) After a transaction is sent, you got the transaction hash shown at the bottom of extension page.
(5) Click the transaction hash in tab `Send-TX` to check transaction status
(6) Another way to check your transaction status is to copy your transaction hash to `check-TX` to view the result.
```
